# PasswordGenerator
Simple Password Generator powered by Python Language.

The code was written using Jupyter Notebook .ipynb file extension for a better understanding.
The purpose of the script is to randomize passwords and then save it to a txt file, storing the info/password generated, along with a brief description *in portuguese* so the user has it to verify later on. 

I also had the help from some articles while doing this little script and am very thankful for ['Ayushi Rawat'](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/create-a-random-password-generator-using-python-2fea485e9da9).

The problem I intend to solve here is the lack of criativity and to spare less time while wanting to set a new password.
